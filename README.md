# Visualiser for Shoring Walls

... which consists of a row of piles, allows for the investigation of the potential final layout of the as-built structure at various depths, taking into account the specified tolerance for verticality during installation.

The deviation direction of each pile can be specified by providing a set (array) of angle values in radians. If not specified, these values will be randomly assigned by the program.

Here are some example input and resultant outputs:

<table>
<tr>
<th>
⌀1200mm secant pile wall, 1000mm c/c spacing (200mm overlap) and verticality tolerance of 1:150
</th>
<th>
⌀273mm micro piles (tubes), 373mm c/c spacing (100mm gaps) and verticality tolerance of 1:100
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
